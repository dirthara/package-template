# Project instructions

## Ownership
Dirthara owns this package. Attribute copyright, licensing, and authorship to
`Dirthara` rather than to an individual maintainer. The MIT `LICENSE` reads
`Copyright (c) <year> Dirthara`, and new files or documents that name an owner
use the same name.

## Branching
Every supported version has its own branch; there is no `main`. Target a feature at
the newest release branch and a fix at the earliest supported branch that has the bug,
then forward-merge upward. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before branching,
merging, or releasing.

## Committing
Never run `git commit`, `git push`, `git tag`, or anything else that writes to
history or to the remote. Stage nothing and commit nothing: the maintainer
commits and pushes every change themselves. Leave the work in the working tree
and say what is ready.

## Tests
Line coverage of `src` must stay at 100%; `composer coverage` fails below it and lists
the uncovered lines. Add tests in `tests` with every implementation change.
The empty scaffold explicitly skips tests and coverage until PHP files exist in
`src` or `tests`; after that, the full checks are required.
Behaviour that needs a real database belongs in the shared conformance suite in
`tests/Integration`, not in a copy per driver.

## Development
Use the PHP container for Composer and PHP commands; see [README.md](README.md).
`docker compose up -d php` also starts the PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server
services the tests run against, and waits until each is healthy.
Use the `Dirthara\__NAMESPACE__` namespace for source and `Dirthara\__NAMESPACE__\Tests`
for tests. Declare strict types in every PHP file.

## Exceptions
Read and follow [exception conventions](agents/exceptions.md) when creating or modifying exceptions.

## Documentation
Read and follow [documentation conventions](agents/documentation.md) when writing the README or anything in `docs`.
